                              <img class="fighter-profile" src="http://csis-ilab.github.io/js-viz/routes-map/img/Abdaoui.jpg">

                            <p><span class="subtitles" style="color:#62A896;">WALID ABDAOUI</span> grew up in the town of Oueslatia, 25 miles west of Kairouan. He was one of eight children in a middle-class family that prized education. His older sister is an agricultural engineer, and his father is a health technician. Abdaoui was building his own career and had been accepted to work at a burns and trauma center outside of Tunis. It was the same medical center where doctors attempted to treat Mohamed Bouazizi, the street vendor who set himself on fire in December 2010, and inspired tens of thousands of protesters across the country.</p>

                              <p>Abdaoui was not a salafist, according to family members, but jihadi-salafi recruiters influenced him at a vulnerable time in his life. His twin brother Khaled departed for Syria in 2013 where he joined Jabhat al-Nusra and later the Islamic State group. His brother’s departure left Abdaoui “in shock,” according to their sister. In family accounts, Walid tried at first to convince his brother Khaled to return home. Instead, he ended up following his brother’s path and joined the Islamic State group.</p>

                              <p>Abdaoui left Tunisia in September 2014 en route to Libya. He made the journey with four other young men from Oueslatia, all of them relatives and neighbors.</p>

                            <p>Walid Abdaoui never met his brother in Syria. Instead, he died in clashes in Benghazi, Libya, on November 25, 2014, just over two months after leaving home. A month earlier, one of his fellow-travelers from his home town, Bilal Kaabi, died conducting a suicide bombing in Benghazi. In early 2015, Walid’s brother Khaled apparently died in combat in Syria, days after he appeared in an ISG video executing another fighter.</p>

  <p>Abdaoui’s family accuses a network of recruiters of courting their son in person and online over the course of more than a year. After his sister logged onto his Facebook account in mid-2013, she discovered conversations with a man offering to arrange for Abdaoui’s transport out of Tunisia and even to pay his way. Abdaoui’s family claim that they grew alarmed and asked the police to intervene but insist that the authorities did nothing to stop their son from leaving. When news of his death reached home, relatives and neighbors reportedly led a symbolic funeral procession to the doors of local government buildings, where they demanded that authorities crack down on facilitators they say prey on local youth.</p>

                          <p><span class="subtitles" style="color:#C39F45;">TARIQ AL-HARZI</span> was born in 1981 or 1982 in Tunis, he was a senior ISG commander believed by U.S. intelligence to be one of the first veteran operatives to join the Islamic State group. Harzi, known by the nom de guerre Abu Umar al-Tunisi, coordinated suicide and car bombings in Iraq and worked closely with his brother to move weapons from Libya to Syria for the Islamic State group.</p>

                            <p>According to UN reports, Harzi first entered Iraq as a young fighter in 2004 and was active in the Islamic State group’s predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq, between periods of imprisonment by U.S. and later Iraqi forces. Some have suggested he may be the same Abu Umar identified in the Sinjar records as having facilitated the movement of Tunisian and other foreign fighters to Iraq through Damascus from 2006 to 2007. Harzi was twice imprisoned by the U.S. military and transferred to the custody of Iraqi forces in 2009. He was freed from his most recent imprisonment in Abu Ghraib in a prison break in July 2013. Harzi was later named the ISG emir for the border region between Syria and Turkey.</p>

                            <p>Harzi orchestrated the flow of financial, material, and human resources to the Islamic State group. He was also reportedly involved in fundraising from Arab Gulf donors—facilitating the transfer of around $2 million from a Qatar-based financier. He coordinated the logistics networks behind suicide attacks in Iraq, earning the moniker of “emir of suicide bombers.” From his post between Syria and Turkey, Harzi worked to recruit, arm, and transport foreign fighters, including many Europeans. As early as 2014, he began recruiting North African fighters. In recognition of the varied and high-level roles Harzi played in sustaining the Islamic State group’s operations, the U.S. government offered $3 million for information leading to his capture.</p>

                          <p>Harzi’s brother Ali, who worked closely with him to ship weapons from Libya to Syria, was listed as a “person of interest” in the September 2012 Benghazi attack that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. A month after the Benghazi attack, Ali al-Harzi was arrested in Istanbul trying to enter Turkey with a false passport and deported to Tunisia. In January 2013, he was released by Tunisian authorities reportedly for lack of evidence. Afterward, U.S. authorities believe he traveled to Syria and eventually returned to Iraq.</p>

                            <p>Ali al-Harzi was killed by a U.S. airstrike in Mosul, Iraq, in June 2015. A day later, another airstrike killed his brother Tariq al-Harzi in Syria’s northeastern Hassakeh Province.</p>
