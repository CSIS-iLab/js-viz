A few notes about the code.

- Dependencies: jQuery 1.12.0
- All CSS selectors use the prefix "cv-"
- A default "normalize.css" file was included. This can be removed or swapped out for the CSIS style reset
- The "#container" element is temporary and can be removed in production along with the corresponding style rules
